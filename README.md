# ESP8266
Sample codes for ESP8266 development boards for Internet of Things applications using DeviceHUB.net platform.

DeviceHub.net is an IoT platform that bridges the gap between hardware devices and mobile/web developers by providing a collection of straightforward APIs to both ends. The web platform, not only gathers data but makes sense of the data spewed out by billions of connected devices and helps people make smarter decisions by giving them the possibility to remote control the devices.

# Documentation
